# Drakes-Adventures
AIV School exercise with Phaser and Wamp.net 
This is a platform demo in 2D where you can use 2 types of dinosaurs each one with his power: the red one can eat only the dragon fruit and shoot a fireball, the yellow can eat only the banana and shoot stars. The fireball is slower and less precise than the star. 
They must have collected 3 fruits to use the power, but if a enemy hits the dino, he loses a fruit and if it doesn't have any left, loses a life. 
Both of them can eat the pies, 50 are needed to gain a life. 
If one of the dinosaurs has lost all lives, you can still use the other. You can change the dino anytime.
