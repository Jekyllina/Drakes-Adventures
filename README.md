This is a platform demo in 2D where you can use 2 type of dinosaurs each one with his power: the red one can eat only the dragon fruit and shoot a fireball, the yellow can eat only the banana and shoot stars. They must have collected 3 fruits for use the power, but if a enemy hit the dino, he lose a fruit and if it doesn't have a fruit, lose a life. 
Both of them can eat the pies, 50 are needed for gain a life.
